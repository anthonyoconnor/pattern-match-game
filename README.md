# pattern-match-game
A little pattern matching game that works on an arduino.

This game consists of 4 LEDs and 4 buttons. The LEDs light up in sequence and you must press the buttons in the correct sequence to match the LEDs.
After three successful sequences the level gets harder and an extra LED is added to the sequence. This goes as far as 10 in the sequence.

There is a blog post about it [here](https://www.anthonyoconnor.ca/blog/pattern-matching-game).
